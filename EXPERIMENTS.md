# Experiments log

Corkscrew, 1 lap, standing start, car1-ow1 (`scr_server`). All runs are headless (`baseline/run_lap.py`).

- **Det. lap**: one run with `-t 1000000`. scr_server waits for every command, so the result is reproducible.
- **Robust**: N runs with the TORCS default UDP timeout (10 ms). Late commands get skipped, as they can be in a real race.
  A crash is a run that does not finish or that ends with damage > 0.

| Date | Experiment | What changed | Det. lap (s) | Det. damage | Robust N | Crash rate | Robust mean / best (s) | Robust max damage |

| 2026-10-15 | E0 IBM sample | `torcs_jm_par.drive_modular`, default settings | DNF (crash ~2.47 km) | 252 | – | – | – | – |
| 2026-10-15 | E1 baseline | `my_driver.py` + `best_params.json` from `main` (README claims 83.63 s from GUI runs) | 84.788 | 0 | 6 (ad hoc) | 3/6 | 84.788 / 84.788 | 134 |
